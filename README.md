# Bangladesh University Select

A small front-end app to help students in Bangladesh filter universities by area, type, program and budget. Designed with a Gen‑Z friendly UI.

## What's included

- Vite + React scaffold
- Clean UI with responsive cards
- Search form (area, type, program, budget)
- Sample dataset in `src/data/universities.json`

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell and cd into the project folder:

```powershell
cd "e:\Duranta\web-dev-projects\uni ranking"
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes and next steps

- This is a front-end prototype with sample data. To persist user data or serve a large dataset, add a backend API.
- You can extend the dataset in `src/data/universities.json` and add images to `public/`.
- UI improvements: animations, filtering by ranking, bookmark feature, authentication.
